Introduction
############

ClearTK provides a framework for developing statistical natural language 
processing (NLP) components in Java and is built on top of Apache UIMA. It is 
developed by the Center for Computational Language and Education Research 
(CLEAR) at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

ClearTK is built with Maven and we recommend that you build your project that
depends on ClearTK with Maven.  This will allow you to add dependencies for only
the parts of ClearTK that you are interested and automatically pull in only 
those dependencies that those parts depend on.  The zip file you have downloaded
is provided as a convenience to those who are unable to build with Maven.  It 
provides jar files for each of the sub-projects of ClearTK as well as all the 
dependencies that each of those sub-projects uses.  To use ClearTK in your 
Java project, simply add all of these jar files to your classpath.  If you are
only interested in one (or a few) sub-project of ClearTK, then you may not want
to add every jar file provided here.  Please consult the maven build files to 
determine which jar files are required for the parts of ClearTK you want to use.   

Please see the section titled "Dependencies" below for important licensing information.

Dependencies
############

ClearTK depends on a variety of different open source libraries that are
redistributed here subject to the respective licensing terms provided by 
each library.  We have been careful to use only libraries that are 
commercially friendly.  Please see the notes below for exceptions.  For a 
complete listing of the dependencies and their respective licenses please
see the file licenses/index.html.

################
GPL Dependencies
################

ClearTK has two sub-projects that depend on GPL licensed libraries: 
 * cleartk-syntax-berkeley
 * cleartk-stanford-corenlp
Neither of these projects nor their dependencies are provided in this release.
To obtain these projects, please manually download them from our googlecode
hosted maven repository:

http://cleartk.googlecode.com/svn/repo/org/cleartk/cleartk-syntax-berkeley/
http://cleartk.googlecode.com/svn/repo/org/cleartk/cleartk-stanford-corenlp/

########
SVMLIGHT
########

ClearTK also has two projects called cleartk-ml-svmlight and cleartk-ml-tksvmlight
which have special licensing considerations. The ClearTK project does not 
redistribute SVMlight. ClearTK does, however, facilitate the building of SVMlight 
models via the ClassifierBuilder interface. In order to use the implementations of
this interface to good effect you will need to have SVMlight installed on your
machine. The ClassifierBuilders for SVMlight simply call the executable "svm_learn"
provided by the SVMlight distribution. ClearTK does not use SVMlight at
classification time - it only uses the models that are build by SVMlight. Instead,
ClearTK provides its own code for classification that makes use of an SVMlight
generated model.  This code is provided with ClearTK and is available with the
above BSD license as is all of the other code written for ClearTK. Therefore, be
advised that while ClearTK is not required (or compelled) to redistribute the code
or license of SVMlight or to comply with it (i.e. the noncommercial license
provided by SVMlight is not compatible with our BSD License) - it would be very
difficult to use the SVMlight wrappers we provide in a commercial setting without
obtaining a license for SVMlight directly from its authors.  

####
LGPL
####

The cleartk-ml-mallet project depends on Mallet (http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/),
which depends on trove4j (http://trove.starlight-systems.com/), which is
released under the LGPL license. If you do not need Mallet classifiers and would
like to avoid the LGPL license, you can omit the cleartk-ml-mallet dependency.

Malt Parser Wrapper
###################

The project cleartk-syntax-dependency-malt was not added to this release because it 
made the ClearTK download too large (i.e. above 100MB).  We are working on releasing 
a much smaller zip file that is not bloated with large classifier model files.  Please
see issue http://code.google.com/p/cleartk/issues/detail?id=263 for details.  To obtain 
this projects, please manually download them from our googlecode hosted maven repository:

http://cleartk.googlecode.com/svn/repo/org/cleartk/cleartk-syntax-dependency-malt/
